# Hooking System

**Hooking System** is a very simple and powerful JavaScript library that will let you implement your own system of hooks, in a fast and reliable way, with almost no effort. It already takes care about some considerations that you might want to have already implemented in a hooking system.

*Note: the Hooking System library is a side-agnostic implementation, and it will work the same for Node.js, and for the browser.*

## 1. Installation

**Installation for Node.js**

In the console:

    ~$ npm install hooking-system --save

Then, in the code, you can import the main class of the project like this:

    const HookingSystem = require("hooking-system");

From here, you can start using the library.

**Installation for the browser**

Import the file located at *src/hooking-system.js* (from the NPM project downloaded above). For example:

    <script src="node_modules/src/hooking-system.js"></script>

From here, you can find the main class loaded in the variable *HookingSystem*, and so, you can start using the library.
